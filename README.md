# Enhancers_and_TFBS_Presence
Looking at how all insect TFBS from the JASPAR database correlate with enhancer function in Drosophila

### alignments

- I got these aligned sequences from a research project headed by Ciera Martinez. She got the raw sequences from a paper (Khan et. al.) and she did some processing and QC on them.


### insect_pfms

- I downloaded these from the JASPAR database. I used all the TFBS JASPAR PFMs from the insect database


### Thomas_Lane_MCB288

- This is the notebook where I run my experiment.
